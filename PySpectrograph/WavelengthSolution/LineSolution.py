"""LineSolution is a task describing the functional form for transforming
pixel position to wavelength.  The inputs for this task are the given pixel position
and the corresponding wavelength.  The user selects an input functional form and
order for that form.  The task then calculates the coefficients for that form.
Possible options for the wavelength solution include polynomial, legendre, spline.
